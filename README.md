# Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. The game progresses as the sequence becomes longer.

## Features 

- **Responsive Design:** The game is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Color Sequence:** A sequence of colors is shown to the player, who must then repeat the sequence.
- **Difficulty Progression:** As the player correctly repeats sequences, the difficulty increases with longer sequences.
- **Audio Feedback:** Each color is associated with a sound to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the player repeats the sequence incorrectly, and they can start again.
